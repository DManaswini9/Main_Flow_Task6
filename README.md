# Task 6 â€“ Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning

This project is part of my Data Science with Python Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
It focuses on building a basic Machine Learning model to understand data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation using regression techniques.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

Data Collection â€“ Imported and explored the dataset
Data Preprocessing â€“
Handling missing values
Feature selection
Data normalization/scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“
Visualized trends and distributions
Line plots and statistical summaries
Model Building â€“ Implemented regression algorithms (Linear Regression as baseline)
Model Evaluation â€“ Assessed performance using:
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score
Predictions â€“ Generated predictions on test/unseen data

## ðŸ“Š Outcomes

Built a complete ML pipeline from raw dataset to predictions
Learned data preprocessing and visualization techniques
Evaluated model performance using error metrics
Gained hands-on experience with scikit-learn regression models
Understood the importance of EDA in model building

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
