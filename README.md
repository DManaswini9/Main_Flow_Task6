# Task 6 â€“ Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning

This project is part of my Data Science with Python Internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
It focuses on building a basic Machine Learning model to understand data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and performance evaluation using regression techniques.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Imported and explored the dataset  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Performed feature selection  
   - Applied normalization/scaling  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized data distributions  
   - Plotted sales trends and patterns  
   - Checked correlations between features  

4. **Model Building**  
   - Implemented Linear Regression as the baseline model  
   - Trained the model on prepared data  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assessed performance using metrics:  
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
     - RÂ² Score  

6. **Predictions**  
   - Generated predictions on test/unseen data  
   - Compared actual vs. predicted values using visualizations
   -
